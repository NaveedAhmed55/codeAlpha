This repository is for an internship completed with CodeAlpha, involving three web development tasks using HTML, CSS, and JS. The tasks are as follows:

1. **Task 1 - Integrated Captcha:**
   A form was created and deployed on Vercel. A Google reCAPTCHA was integrated into the form.


2. **Task 2 - Wordpress Site:**
   A WordPress site was created. The site was hosted on WordPress, and an account was set up.

3. **Task 3 - Multipage Survey Form:**
   A multipage survey form was developed that saves user input across pages and submits the data via email.

The repository also includes a list of tasks, the technologies used (HTML, CSS, JS), and the author's GitHub profile.
